        <h3> About Us</h3>
        <p>
            We are a community organisation giving prisoners the skills to develop a new hobby which can be done both in class and in their cells. One maker regularly spends up to 30 hours a week accurately folding colourful structures for the fronts of the cards. He says, “In this environment there are many challenges from huge queues and delays, to noise, to a multitude of other things. Having origami to concentrate on helps distract and overcome these challenges. Instead of being frustrated at a 25 minute, unexplained, delay you can end up feeling calm and pleased that you’re doing something constructive and tangible to help others. There are few positives in this environment, but origami is definitely one of them.”
